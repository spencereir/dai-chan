Dai-chan
=========================
Dai-chan is the spiritual successor to CirnoBot, whose creation was inspired by CirnoBot's sudden decision to stop working entirely. So it goes.

Dai-chan is written using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and features a much more robust system for parsing commands and options. The code structure makes it much easier to work with than CirnoBot overall.

Currently Dai-chan supports only a few basic features; more will be added to mimic CirnoBot's full functionality as time goes on.
